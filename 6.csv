It was annoying though because I kept getting bumped into by the servers, and one in particular apologized only after I stared at her after she bumped into me 5 times. The noise level was also an issue, and we could only hear each other if we yelled across the table.\n\nThe food was good and our waitress was very friendly but if I wanted tapas I'd probably stick with going to Barcelona Wine Bar, especially since you can make reservations there.","en","12221852768954856409-1583954061.658"

Ordered Loretta beer that was on the menu by oxbow brewing . The beer bottle was so warm that I had to ask for a glass with ice in it to drink the beer . The food was ok . There are much much better tapas places around . \nAlso not sure what a 3% wellness charge is on the bill . Never seen it before . Definitely not going back .","en","12221852768954856409-1583621504.877"
