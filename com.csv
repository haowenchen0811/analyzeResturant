I was excited to go there given the reputation the restaurant has with customers and foodies.  My initial reaction to the few tapas we ordered was unfavorable.  We ordered a fish dip made of Sea Bass and Octopus tapas and both were extremely salty.  They provided bread with the Tapas which makes the combination of bread and salty food serious bloating.  I was very disappointed and will not be going there again unless they change this situation.  WE all know that restaurants add a lot of salt to their foods and bread to entice drinking -- A BAD COMBINATION and a disingenuous one.  YOU CAN DO BETTER.  They have forgotten how to cook for taste.,en,12221852768954856409-1596628359.839

The place was packed and there seemed to be an endless amount of people trying to get a table as we dined here.  Fortunately I had made a reservation a month in advance and had no trouble getting my table.  Despite the somewhat cramped seating arrangement that they have throughout this place we were both very pleased with our meal and experience.  We started our meal with the Queso Mahon which was outstanding.  Our waiter said he would bring us bread for this but it never came.  We also got the Pan con Tomate which was also very good.  Next came the Maíz Asado which was some of the best street corn we’ve ever had.  Our waiter recommended the lamb ribs which came after, these were also very good and the date bbq sauce provided a unique taste.  On a whim we also ordered the Tortilla Española, this was the big miss of the night.  It was a cold preparation (I don’t like my eggs cold) and salty to the point that it was almost inedible.  We told our waiter and he immediately took it off the bill and replaced it with the Escalivada Catalana which was excellent and something I can’t wait to have again.  We ended the meal with Potatoes Bravas which was better than most other variations I’ve had of this dish.  Overall we came on a busy night and a couple things were missed (bread, and a straw my wife asked for several times and never got), but the hassle free removal of the egg dish from the bill, and attentiveness of most of the staff made for an enjoyable evening.  I will definitely come back here!",en,12221852768954856409-1581962505.375
