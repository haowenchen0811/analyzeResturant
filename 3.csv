We order Octopus, duck, ribs and ham. They gave us 2 long joined tables which was for 6 persons . When I asked to sperate these tables to be more confortable with my girl, they said NO, we can not move 1 feet. \nSo disappointed. I just wanna make 1 feet space in our area, and seat near to her. \nTheir food quality is good, but customer servis and customer management  NO.","en","12221852768954856409-1593906509.085"

We just got the takeout multi course meal with wine deal from GILT City to use for our 4th anniversary dinner.  There was a slight hiccup when I went to pickup but their professionalism just showed why this has been a favorite restaurant of ours for years. The food we got was fantastic and we couldn’t finish it all. The lobster paella in particular was a standout. Thank you again for making it a wonderful, special meal. We can’t wait to use our reservation once you have indoor dining again!  I wish I had the managers name to thank her personally but thank you for making it a wonderful night!","en","12221852768954856409-1593129082.413"
