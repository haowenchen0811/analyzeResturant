Incredible dining experience. Blessed to have caught the last dinner service before shutting down temporarily. Very inspiring experience from an aspiring chef visiting from atlanta! Toro is a must for anyone looking for a great dining experience. Cant wait to come back post-Corona","en","12221852768954856409-1584630449.33"

If you are lucky enough to get a reservation for lunch or dinner take it! You could eat here alone or dine with a small group of friends. The atmosphere is slow paced and quiet which is perfect for the food. Completely antitypical American size portions, food, ingredients, etc.\n\nCome here if you're ready to embrace spanish-style, thoughtfully prepared tapas. We came hungry and excited for interesting plates and wines and we left wanting to come back for dinner. Put this on your Boston bucket list if you are visiting or if you need to get out of a rut and live your best life.","en","12221852768954856409-1584036145.456"
